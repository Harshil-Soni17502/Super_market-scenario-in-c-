# Super_market scenario in C++
Everyody has gone to the supermarket. So in supermarket we come across various different kind of scenarios like choosing the item to purchase,then going to the billing counter and generating the bill, updating the points of the customer according to the amount of the bill generated, etc. All ths scenarios are experienced by the customer. But there are also other scenarios included in the supermarket that are not experienced by the customer but are experienced by the manager of the supermarket like maintaining the inventory database, maintaining the customer database, changing and updating the number of items in database ,deleting the items from database and many more and all these scenarios are experienced by the manager of the supermarket. So here I had tried to make the software implementation of the supermarket in C++ language where all these scenarios are included.
